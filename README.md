Hi, I'm Lusayo.

I'm a Software Engineer with experience in Python (Django/FastAPI), TypeScript (Next.js/React/Node), Dart (Flutter), and Java (Kafka/Flink).

I also work across Data Engineering building streaming pipelines and orchestration with Kafka, Flink, and Airflow. This repository is my personal portfolio, statically exported to GitHub Pages with a file-based CMS under `content/`.
